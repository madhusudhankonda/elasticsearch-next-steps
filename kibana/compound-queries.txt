As it runs on Android 9 Pie, you’ll have access to anything from social and shopping apps, to banking apps to help out with your finances. And when you’ve got your hands full with the kids, you can use its voice controls and ask Google to check the weather or set a reminder for tomorrow’s play date, before you rush them out the door. Plus, it’s got a fabulous 10.3-inch Full HD+ display and Dolby Atmos sound tech, so it’s great for getting under the covers and watching a film, as it shows off all the action in brilliant detail. You won’t have to worry about it cutting out mid-scene either, since it comes with a 9-hour battery life, while the 64GB of storage gives you room for all your downloads. What’s more, when you’ve been busy DIY-ing and upcycling, you can snap a pic and proudly show it off to the world with the 8MP camera.","user_ratings": 4.8, "images": ""}
